# Get Started
To build Talking Duck, you could build from docker or setup a conda environment.


## Docker Setup

If you prefer to keep your machine clean and run everything in containers, **TALKING DUCK** is Docker-ready! Just follow these simple steps to containerize the quack:

### Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the root directory of the cloned project where the `Dockerfile` is located, and run:

```bash
docker build -t talking-duck .
```

This command builds a Docker image named `talking-duck` based on the instructions in your `Dockerfile`.

### Run the Container

Once the build is complete, you can run **TALKING DUCK** in a Docker container using:

```bash
docker run -p 7860:7860 talking-duck
```

This command starts a container from the `talking-duck` image, mapping port 7860 of the container to port 7860 on your host machine. 

### Visit Your Duck

Open your favorite web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7860` to interact with **TALKING DUCK**. No installation mess, just pure, unadulterated duck fun.

### Docker Compose (Optional)

For an even easier setup, if you have a `docker-compose.yml` file at the root of your project, you can start **TALKING DUCK** with just one command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command uses Docker Compose to build the image and run the container as defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file. It's perfect for when you want to get up and running with minimal fuss.

---

**Note:** Be sure to adjust the `docker build` and `docker run` commands based on your specific Docker setup, including the correct image names and any additional options you might need. The instructions above assume a basic setup for demonstration purposes.

Don't forget to check the Docker and Docker Compose documentation for more detailed information on building and running containers.
