## What's the Quack?

**TALKING DUCK** is an LLM-powered chatbot that does more than just float around. It listens (literally) to your code problems, thanks to its audio-to-text superpower, and then it gets its webbed feet dirty by diving into the depths of code logic to bring you pearls of wisdom... or at least, the answers to your coding questions.

Whether you're tangled in the vines of Python, lost in the braces of JavaScript, or just need someone to tell you "It's gonna be okay, buddy," **TALKING DUCK** is your go-to aquatic ally.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¤ **Audio Input**: Just quack your question into your mic.
- ðŸ¤” **Smart Analysis**: Leveraging the brainy might of LLM models, including the one and only `mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1`.
- ðŸ’¡ **Insightful Answers**: Get recommendations, solutions, and sometimes just a friendly quack.
- ðŸ¦† **Fun Interface**: Because who said coding assistants need to be boring?


# Get Started
To build Talking Duck, you could build from docker or setup a conda environment.


## Docker Setup

If you prefer to keep your machine clean and run everything in containers, **TALKING DUCK** is Docker-ready! Just follow these simple steps to containerize the quack:

### Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the root directory of the cloned project where the `Dockerfile` is located, and run:

```bash
docker build -t talking-duck .
```

This command builds a Docker image named `talking-duck` based on the instructions in your `Dockerfile`.

### Run the Container

Once the build is complete, you can run **TALKING DUCK** in a Docker container using:

```bash
docker run -p 7860:7860 talking-duck
```

This command starts a container from the `talking-duck` image, mapping port 7860 of the container to port 7860 on your host machine. 

### Visit Your Duck

Open your favorite web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7860` to interact with **TALKING DUCK**. No installation mess, just pure, unadulterated duck fun.

### Docker Compose (Optional)

For an even easier setup, if you have a `docker-compose.yml` file at the root of your project, you can start **TALKING DUCK** with just one command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command uses Docker Compose to build the image and run the container as defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file. It's perfect for when you want to get up and running with minimal fuss.

---

**Note:** Be sure to adjust the `docker build` and `docker run` commands based on your specific Docker setup, including the correct image names and any additional options you might need. The instructions above assume a basic setup for demonstration purposes.

Don't forget to check the Docker and Docker Compose documentation for more detailed information on building and running containers.
